# Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Check to make sure the project requirements are installed. In the terminal, type:

    ```
    which python pip node npm
    ```

    The output should look similar to this:

    ```
    /usr/bin/python
    /usr/local/bin/pip
    /usr/local/bin/node
    /usr/local/bin/npm
    ```

2. Sign in to your [Github](https://github.com/) account.

    a. Fork the [project](https://github.com/stormpython/insightfl) by click on `Fork` in the upper right hand side of
    the screen.
    b. Follow the [Dev Environment Setup](https://github.com/stormpython/insightfl#dev-environment-setup-) guide.

After you've completed setting up your development environment, go to the [Deploying to AWS]() guide.
