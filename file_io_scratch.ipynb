This version of Classic Albums doesn't capture the historical significance of this album, concentrating more on its production and aesthetics. But who cares? This is a celebration of their music and one of the greatest albums of the rock era.\n",

Thank goodness this was not the first one I ever got or I might not have tried again.What attracted me was that it is waterproof which has been an occasional lifesaver for shower time. I would normally not want the controls on the base though so I really don't want to even look at this option if I'm anywhere dry. I find it awkward to have to reach like that when adjustment is needed on intensity/speed. I also notice that the weight of the batteries at the base of the device requires more attention from me to keep the fun where it needs to be. In my other rabbits, having the control and battery pack as a separated portion allows me to easily and naturally deal with any sudden need to change the action in a comfortable position. It also makes the business end easier to handle, prop,maneuver, etc since it doesn't have all the extra baggage and weight at the base.The girth is a bit gluttonous for my tastes but it's not unmanageable. The beads inside look and sound a bit too scary and have not actually felt worthwhile to me. The ability to change direction has no appeal for me either but perhaps if someone is using the tip of the shaft for some foreplay this could be useful. I don't find it to be soft enough or set for a proper path to make that interesting with this device though. Other rabbits of more modest size have definitely delivered larger return though.The ears are too stiff and sometimes can hurt if not careful. ...and really, how careful can you remain when you are trying to let go and \"enjoy?\" For me, perhaps it's a YMMV thing, the ears also don't naturally land where they should when the other business aspect is where it needs to be. This requires some odd posturing and holding but it can be done to the desired end result. I have to emphasize that even when that result is achieved, my other rabbits give a higher quality reward and often in less time unless I purposely played it to last longer.Out of the package, the smell was really strong and surprised me since I had never noticed this in others I've gotten. It did not fade quickly in spite of repeated washing and even now it still smells \"industrial.\"I would not buy this model again so hopefully I'll find a better waterproof rabbit option next time.\n",

The entire vibrator turned a yellow tint from where the beads are down to the base. It was one of our favorite toys for a while, until we discovered how cheaply built it was. The battery holder was the problem. It is cheaply made, so the thin contacts in the battery compartment which slides into the device are the most likely thing to break, which we soon discovered. What I learned from this was, you have to put your money where your mouth is when it comes to getting a quality sex toy. If you go cheap, you can go home. Forget this one. It is not a good investment and it will just break on you. In the short term, a couple of months, it will last, but don't expect it to work much longer than that. We didn't even use it that often and it still broke down. Also, it was only $25 when we bought it, now they have gone up on the price. Forget it - NOT worth your money people!

It still works like the first day I got it. I love that this toy's ears aren't so soft you can't feel the vibration. The ears of the rabbit are stiff. My only complaint would be that I would have liked a softer head and shaft with the firm ears. GREAT BUY. We purchased mine at the sex store for $60+tax.\n",

However, when it arrived it was larger than advertised (length and circumference). It was actually to large and caused some discomfort. It has a very hard plasltic like feeling which did not help with insertion. It seems to be well built if you are looking for the terminator of vibrators!! If you have had a few kids and need something bigger and harded, this is for you! For us it was a waste of the money spent as we will not be using it again.|keltydelimit| B000N8X038\n",

This product gets my girlfriend going wild, she loves the multiple stimulations it provides both inside and out. This is the 2nd one I've bought because about a year of use the floating beads would no longer work. She loved it so much we bought another one.|keltydelimit| B000N8X038\n",

We've actually had 3 of them. Wore out the first 2 over the course of about a year each. This has never failed to please her.The only issue we have noticed with them, is the rubber seems to react with other rubber types and \"melt\". We have had it happen with all 3 of them. So if you keep your toys together (touching) like we do, you may want to keep this one in it's packaging so it doesn't get an impression of another toy melted into it.It does tend to get louder the more you use it or the older it gets. At first it was very quite, but now we have to keep a hold on the rabbit to stop the noise from being overly loud (Especially if the kids are home).Again, all the cons happen over time. We will probably keep on of these as long as we can continue to buy them. It's just really good at what it does even if it doesn't last forever.|keltydelimit| B000N8X038\n",

I have not tried it in water so I can't comment on that. It is also too stiff (rather than being too big), but mostly my issue is the very weak vibration, especially lacking in the area that should be stimulated most. The rotation also did nothing for me. With a name like Jackrabbit, I was expecting a lot more oomph. Don't bother with this product if your preference is not gentle... I found it annoying.|keltydelimit| B000N8X038\n",
