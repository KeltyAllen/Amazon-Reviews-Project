# Amazon Project
Web app that takes name of an Amazon product, gives you the graph of average review score over time and pulls out reviews that contain over-represented n-grams for that product in a time range. Default time range is first time that review rate is higher than average both locally and globally. Also can take user-entered time range. 


Main script is app/views.py
